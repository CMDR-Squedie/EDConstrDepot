A minimalistic transparent overlay tool to track construction depots from Elite Dangerous player journals.

It also features a myriad of tools to assist you with colonization, like colony management and planning, market suggestions etc.

Features:
- construction depot commodity/progress tracking
- indicators for availability at current/recent market (available commodities sort as first)
- indicators for availablity at selected visited markets (including Fleet Carriers)
- indicators for hauling under capacity or hauling more than required (for absent-minded people like myself :)
- simulate Fleet Carrier Purchase orders as construction depot; compare orders with construction needs
- simulate Fleet Carrier Sell offers as available cargo
- group several active constructions as one (useful for FC loading or multiple low quantity requests)
- show original request for finished constructions
- suggest best markets for current request; add markets to Ignored/Favorite list
- select market to see commodity availability (double-click market name in market list)
- select commodity to see which markets supply it (double click on commodity name in overlay window)
- list of visited markets, with their economies
- list of commodities sold in market (double-click market economy)
- track colony market history with snapshots (manual or automatic)
- compare markets, or snapshots of same market (eg. after strong/weak links were added) [details](https://github.com/CMDR-Squedie/EDConstrDepot/wiki#compare-markets-and-market-history)
- delivery time left, average dock-to-dock time and most recent time; delivery history with recent markets [details](https://github.com/CMDR-Squedie/EDConstrDepot/wiki#delivery-times)
- manage your colonies, colony candidates and colonisation targets [details](https://github.com/CMDR-Squedie/EDConstrDepot/wiki#colonies)
- attach system picture (in-game screenshot with Windows Snipping Tool)
- check construction points, free construction slots and other system statistics
- add planned constructions and check how they influence the economies [details](https://github.com/CMDR-Squedie/EDConstrDepot/wiki#system-body-and-station-economies)
- check bodies from system scan information, check inherent body economies 
- check station economies, strong links and up-links, including planned stations
- manage your colonies from 2D colony map with custom projections and info layers
- task groups - group markets and depots by context (personal projects/location in galaxy etc.)


o7, CMDRs!
